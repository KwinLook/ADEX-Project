# ADEX-Project
The scope of this research is the use of portable X-ray camera equipment suitable for explosive ordnance disposal robots. To store image data used to develop data analysis and machine learning models, including the use of X-ray image data obtained from various cases. These show the presence of explosive-unit elements according to the experience of experts from the Institute of Defense Technology and Royal Thai Air Force: Ordnance Department. To accomplish this goal, the proposed research brings about an effective application of modern artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies in pattern recognition such as deep learning.

## Labels
There are 2 different labels:
1. **explosive**
2. **none-explosive**
